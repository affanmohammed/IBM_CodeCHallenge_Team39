My contribution to the  OnLine Live Certificate is to make a "live image capture" for the person who needs to get the certificate. The procedures are as follows.

Step1	:Start

Step2	:In the first interface we can see a button in blue color saying "Capture photo" as shown in "image1".Click on that button

Step3	:Give webcam permission.If it is not given a warning popup will come as shown in "image2".

Step4:	:After giving permission you can see a yellow button saying "capture photo" as shown in "image3".Click on that button.

Step5	:If an image is blurred or not good then click the "Retake" button else click the "Upload" button as shown in "image4".If an image is uploaded successfully a message will pop up saying "Upload Successful".

Step6	:Stop



These are the procedures that are needed to be done from the user's side.The image that is uploaded is stored in MySQL as shown in "image5"	and also in a 
the folder that is shown in "image6".Then this image is taken for further procedures.


The backend is developed using PHP and jquery and MySQL as the database for storing. The demo for the procedure is uploaded in the demo folder.
