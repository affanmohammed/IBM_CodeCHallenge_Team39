# IBM_CodeCHallenge_Team39
the following project is used for generating "Life Certificate" for pensioners. Every year pensioners have to prove that they are alive and eligible for pensions. 
steps:
1. Login/Register 
2. Verify your account using otp 
3. For renewal of life certificate:
4.      start recording using webcam 
5.      capture images of a pensioner 
6.      verify new image with that in database 
7.      if both images are identical, verification was successful and renewed for 1 more year, certificate is generated.
8.      else, verification failed



Current status of our project:

We currently have designed front end and backend to login capture and store image.
we have a database to store user info.

Our code to compare image is not at its optimal level and needs updation.
Our code to genrate OTP is facing few small errors due to which a proper execution isnt happening at that stage.
The individual modules need to be compiled to make one single webpage/app(.
Our code to live capture currently takes photo which in the next level would be replaced with a video footage taking pictures at random interval with definative facial features.
